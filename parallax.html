<p><span>Encounters with the Cosmos – Using Parallax to Measure Distance
– Name:</span></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<h1 id="background-on-stellar-parallax">Background on stellar
parallax</h1>
<p>Our primary way to measure the distance to nearby stars is through
the use of <em>parallax</em> (an apparent change in position of an
object due to the motion of an observer). As the Earth moves in its
orbit throughout the year, our change in position causes a continuous
change in perspective. The diagram below shows the Earth at four
different positions in its orbit.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="star_parallax_solution.png" style="width:100.0%"
alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Look at the three panels at the bottom of the figure and notice that
the ‘nearby star’ appears to move relative to the background ‘distant
stars’. By measuring the amount that the nearby star moves throughout
the year, we can measure its distance <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> from the Earth.</p>
<p>Note that this figure drastically exaggerates the closeness of both
the nearby and distant stars. In reality, the Earth – Sun distance (1
AU) is extraordinarily small relative to <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. When studying real stars, <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> ranges from a few light years up to a
few hundred light years. Meanwhile, the distant stars are at least
thousands of light years away, effectively stationary.</p>
<p>Your goal in this lab is to measure the distance to use a nearby
‘star’. Your star (a flag) will be placed in a large open field. You
will then take photos of it from different positions. In the photos you
take, the flag will shift relative to the background stars (the distant
trees far across the field). Before you can head out and start snapping
photos, you need to determine the field of view of your camera.</p>
<h1 id="sec:FOV">Calibrating your camera</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="what-is-field-of-view">What is field of
view?</h2>
<p>When you take a photograph, the amount of the subject you capture is
determined by two things: 1) the distance between the camera and the
subject and 2) the <em>field of view</em> (FOV) of your camera. FOV is
defined by the angle that the camera sees both left-right, and also
up-down. As such, it is measured in <em>square degrees</em> (see the
dashed region in the figure below). When you want to make an image
larger you either 1) get closer to the subject or 2) <em>decrease</em>
the FOV which is done by <em>zooming</em> in.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="camera3D.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="determining-your-field-of-view">Determining
your field of view</h2>
<p>Your task, then, is to measure the FOV of our camera. In our case, we
are only interested in side-to-side motion, so you only need to know the
the horizontal FOV. This quantity is represented by the angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in the figure below.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="camera2D.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Find <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> with the following
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Stand back from a wall and face it straight on. In landscape
(horizontal) mode, take a photograph using a low zoom factor. For most
modern cell phones, about 1x zoom should work great.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Record the zoom value of your photo (remember, zooming changes
the FOV) here: <span class="math display">\[{\rm Zoom =
\hspace{2cm}}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Measure the distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> from
the camera to the wall. Record it here: <span class="math display">\[d =
\hspace{1.25cm}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Look at the picture you took and use it to find the edges of the
region on the wall that you photographed. Measure this length <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and record it here: <span
class="math display">\[l = \hspace{1.25cm}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>With <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> we now have enough information to
compute the horizontal FOV <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>,
as follows:<br />
</p>
<div class="minipage">
<p>The triangle to the right represents half of the horizontal FOV of
our camera. Since it is a right triangle, we can use basic trigonometry
to relate <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. The tangent of an angle equals
‘opposite over adjacent’ so <span class="math display">\[\tan (\theta/2)
= \frac{l/2}{d} = \frac{l}{2d}.\]</span> Solve for <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> by using the <span
class="math inline">\(\tan^{-1}\)</span> function. <span
class="math display">\[\theta/2 = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{l}{2d}  \right)
\qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad
\theta = 2\tan^{-1} \left( \frac{l}{2d}  \right)\]</span> Using this
formula, find your value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.
(Make sure your calculator is set to degrees!) Record your <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> here: <span
class="math display">\[\hspace{3.7cm} \theta =\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="minipage">
<div class="center">
<p><img src="triangle.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
</div></li>
</ol>
<p>You are now ready to go outside and measure the distance to your
star!</p>
<h1 id="observations-of-stars">Observations of ‘stars’</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="the-background-stars">The background
‘stars’</h2>
<p>You should now head out to a large field, with trees in the distance
(several hundred feet away). For the purpose of this exercise, those
trees will play the role of our background stars. You want them so far
away that they barely move when you walk back and forth. Take a photo of
those distant trees making sure your camera <strong>is set to the same
zoom value you used while determining your FOV.</strong> Note the
location where you took the photo. Call it Position A.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="field_Open.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Now your teacher will place a ‘star’ (a cone) a distance <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> (maybe 50 - 100 feet) in front of you.
You will take photos of the cone from three different locations. As you
change your position the background trees will appear to move. By
carefully measuring “how much” they move we can measure the distance to
the cone. Your teacher will use a tape measure to find the actual
distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> from Position A to the
cone. Once you’ve made your parallax measurements, you can compare your
inferred distance to what was directly measured.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="the-view-from-position-a">The view from
Position A</h2>
<p>Standing at the same spot as the last photo (Position A), take a
photo of the cone with the trees in the background.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="field_A.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="the-view-from-position-b">The view from
Position B</h2>
<p>Move to your right a distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
(no more than 5 meters). <em>Notice how the trees behind the cone appear
to have changed.</em> Make note of your location and take another photo.
Call this location Position B.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="field_B.png" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>The distance moved from side-to-side is called the <u>baseline</u>.
Record the baseline distance (in feet) <span
class="math inline">\(b_R\)</span> between Positions A and B here: <span
class="math display">\[b_R = B - A = \hspace{1.25cm}\]</span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="the-view-from-position-c">The view from
Position C</h2>
<p>Finally, move to the left of Position A to a new location. Call this
Position C. Take a third photo of the cone. Again, the distant trees
behind the cone should appear to have moved.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="field_C.png" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Record the baseline distance (in feet) <span
class="math inline">\(b_L\)</span> between Positions A and C here: <span
class="math display">\[b_L = A - C = \hspace{1.25cm}\]</span></p>
<h1 id="measuring-the-parallax-angle">Measuring the Parallax Angle</h1>
<p>You will now figure out exactly how much the cone appeared to shift
as you moved between Positions A, B and C.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="preparing-your-view-of-the-background-stars">Preparing your view of
the background stars</h2>
<p>Print out the photo you took of the background trees (with no cone
present). Ask your professor or TA if you need help printing. Your next
step is to use a pen and ruler to mark out even degree spacings on this
photo. Proceed as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What was the horizontal FOV, <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>? You found it above in Sec. <a
href="#sec:FOV" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:FOV">2</a>: <span class="math display">\[\theta =
\hspace{1.15cm}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Use a ruler to measure the width <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> of your printed photo in centimeters.
Record the value here: <span class="math display">\[w =
\hspace{1.25cm}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Compute the number of <strong>centimeters per degree</strong> by
dividing: <span class="math display">\[\frac{w}{\theta} =
\hspace{1.25cm}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>With this value, use a ruler to mark off even degree spacings on
your photograph. An example of what at <span
class="math inline">\(20^\circ\)</span> FOV would look like is shown
below.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="backgroundAngles.jpg" style="width:70.0%"
alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="the-location-of-our-star-from-different-positions">The location of
our ‘star’ from different positions</h2>
<p>Look at the photo you took of the cone from Position A. Note the
cone’s location <strong>relative to the background trees</strong>.
Compare its position to the prepared image from the previous section.
What is the <em>angular location of the cone, as seen from Position
A</em>? <span class="math display">\[\theta_A = \hspace{1.4cm}\]</span>
Now, look a your photos from Positions B and C. Again, look at the trees
behind the cone, compare to your image with marked degrees, and
determine these positions of the cone: <span
class="math display">\[\theta_B = \hspace{3.4cm}
\theta_C =\]</span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="the-parallax-angle">The parallax angle</h2>
<p>We define the <strong>parallax angle</strong> as the angle by which
the cone appears to move when you change locations. You took photos of
your star from three positions. The first position (A) is the baseline.
The angle <span class="math inline">\(p_R\)</span> (see the figure
above) represents the amount by which the cone appeared to move when
going to the <em><strong>right</strong></em> from A to B. Likewise,
<span class="math inline">\(p_C\)</span> gives the amount the cone
shifted when going to the <em><strong>left</strong></em> from A to C.
Record your parallax angles here: <span class="math display">\[p_R
=  \theta_A  - \theta_B =
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
p_L = \theta_C - \theta_A =\]</span></p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="parallaxAngles.png" style="width:80.0%" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<h1 id="inferring-the-distance-to-your-star">Inferring the distance to
your star</h1>
<p>Before you actually compute the distance to your star from the
parallax measurements, write down a guess for how far you think the star
was <span class="math display">\[d_{\rm guess} =\]</span></p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="parallaxAngles2.png" style="width:33.0%" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Finally, we have all the pieces in place to determine the distance to
our star. Because we have measured two baseline distances and two
parallax angles, we have two measurements of distance to the star: <span
class="math display">\[d_L = \frac{b_L}{\tan p_L} =
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
d_R = \frac{b_R}{\tan p_R} =\]</span> Are your two measurements the
same? Are they close to the guess you made?</p>
