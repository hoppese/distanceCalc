<h2 class="unnumbered" id="what-is-field-of-view">What is field of
view?</h2>
<p>When you take a photograph, the amount of the subject you capture is
determined by two things: 1) the distance between the camera and the
subject and 2) the <em>field of view</em> (FOV) of your camera. FOV is
defined by the angle that the camera sees both left-right, and also
up-down. As such, it is measured in <em>square degrees</em> (see the
dashed region in the figure below). When you want to make an image
larger you either 1) get closer to the subject or 2) <em>decrease</em>
the FOV which is done by <em>zooming</em> in.</p>

your field of view</h2>
<p>Your task, then, is to measure the FOV of our camera. In our case, we
are only interested in side-to-side motion, so you only need to know the
the horizontal FOV. This quantity is represented by the angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in the figure below.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img alt="image" src="camera2D.jpg"/></p>
</div>
<p>Find <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> with the following
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Stand back from a wall and face it straight on. In landscape
(horizontal) mode, take a photograph using a low zoom factor. For most
modern cell phones, about 1x zoom should work great.<br/>
</p></li>
<li><p>Record the zoom value of your photo (remember, zooming changes
the FOV) here: <span class="math display">\[{\rm Zoom =
\hspace{2cm}}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Measure the distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> from
the camera to the wall. Record it here: <span class="math display">\[d =
\hspace{1.25cm}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Look at the picture you took and use it to find the edges of the
region on the wall that you photographed. Measure this length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and record it here: <span class="math display">\[l = \hspace{1.25cm}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>With <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> we now have enough information to
compute the horizontal FOV <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>,
as follows:<br/>
</p>
<div class="minipage">
<p>The triangle to the right represents half of the horizontal FOV of
our camera. Since it is a right triangle, we can use basic trigonometry
to relate <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. The tangent of an angle equals
‘opposite over adjacent’ so <span class="math display">\[\tan (\theta/2)
= \frac{l/2}{d} = \frac{l}{2d}.\]</span> Solve for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> by using the <span class="math inline">\(\tan^{-1}\)</span> function. <span class="math display">\[\theta/2 = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{l}{2d}  \right)
\qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad
\theta = 2\tan^{-1} \left( \frac{l}{2d}  \right)\]</span> Using this
formula, find your value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.
(Make sure your calculator is set to degrees!) Record your <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> here: <span class="math display">\[\hspace{3.7cm} \theta =\]</span></p>
